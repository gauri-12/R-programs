The data in the accompanying file “VoterPref.csv” (posted on Canvas) contains data from a survey of random sample of registered voters in a state. The subjects were asked whether they were “For” or “Against” a proposal on the ballot to increase the state sales tax by 0.5%, with the stipulation that the additional tax revenues be spent on education. In addition to their position on the proposition, some additional demographic information is collected. The variables in the data set are:
PREFERENCE AGE
INCOME GENDER
“For” or “Against”
Years of age at time of survey
Annual income in thousands of US dollars “M” or “F”
The intent of the survey is to develop a strategy to target individuals for a marketing campaign designed to “get out the vote”.

I createD random partitions of a data set, built the model on the training data set and then computed prediction errors using the test data set.
