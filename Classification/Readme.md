Csv file contains data pertaining to 1000 personal loan accounts at a bank. 
When a new applicant applies for credit, as a part of the application, the company collects information which is available in the form of Variables 2 to 21. 
The company then decides an amount to be credited (the variable CREDIT_EXTENDED.) 
For these 1000 accounts, we also have information on how profitable did each account turn out to be (variable NPV). 
A negative value indicates a net loss and this typically happens when the debtor defaults on his/her payments.

Goal is to develop a classification regression model to classify a new account as “profitable” or “not profitable”.

Algorithms used:
k-NN and Naive Bayes
